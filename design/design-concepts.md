# Design Concepts

My overall concept is simple and modern by adding a secondary effect when a user hovers their cursor over text/button. I also want to make sure that the page is clutter free, and have each section of text appear when clicked on a button at the top.  That way users feel that they are not being bombarded by too much information at once. The footer of the page will have links to other designs and the resources. 

I feel users are more engaged and interested in the page's content when there is some type of interaction or cause-and-effect happening through their actions.  Therefore I would like to incorporate to my best ability to add buttons that change, or make sound effects when a cursor hovers over it.

Inspirational design would come from Watsondg.com website works. 

My biggest challenge will be making sure the button effects and sounds will function propertly.
